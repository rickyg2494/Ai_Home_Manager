🎯 Key Features Deep Dive
AI Voice Assistant
The AI assistant uses advanced natural language processing to understand and execute commands:
// Example command processing
"Turn on all lights in the living room"
→ Identifies: action (turn on), device type (lights), location (living room)
→ Executes: Finds all lights in living room and turns them on
→ Responds: "I've turned on 3 lights in the living room"
Energy Monitoring
Real-time energy tracking with cost calculations:
Live Consumption: Updates every second
Cost Calculation: Based on local energy rates (configurable)
Usage Trends: Historical data with interactive charts
Savings Tips: AI-generated recommendations
Smart Routines
Pre-configured and custom automation scenarios:
Good Night: Locks doors, turns off lights, sets optimal sleep temperature
Good Morning: Gradual lighting, comfortable temperature, morning briefing
Away Mode: Turns off non-essential devices, activates security
Movie Time: Dims lights, turns on entertainment system


🧪 Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
# Unit tests
flutter test

# Widget tests
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Integration tests
